# Cucumber JSON Schema

The "Cucumber JSON" format was created several years before the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) standard started gaining traction. The lack of a formal schema led to inconsistencies between different Cucumber implementations and releases.

This repository contains JSON Schemas for multiple implementations and versions of Cucumber.
These schemas have been retrofitted to match the actual output of these implementations.

This repository also contains a conversion tool that can convert Cucumber JSON from a Cucumber implementation/version
into a canonical representation following a new, official JSON schema.
